Using C++:

Given the array: int numbers[10] = {1,2,3,4,5}

Write a for loop to assign the number "100" to the number of elements 
up to the size of the array and display those number of elements up
to the size of the array but do not include the zeros, in one single 
line, with each value separated by a space " ".
